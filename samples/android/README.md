Sample Android Application

First, compile wrapper for Android;
```
> node build.js --platform=android --ndk-path=[ndk path here]
```

Under this folder, use `build.sh`

```
> ./build.sh [ndk path here]
```

If you haven't received any error message so far, you can import this solution
into Android Studio or Eclipse and run this application on either Android Device
or Emulator.
